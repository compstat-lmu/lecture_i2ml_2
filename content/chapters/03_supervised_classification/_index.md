title: "Chapter 3: Supervised Classification"

This chapter treats the supervised classification task in more detail. We will see examples of binary and multi-class classification and the differences between discriminative and generative approaches. In particular, we will address logistic regression, linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, naive Bayes and \\(k\\)-NN classification.
