Analogous to regression, we consider essential performance measures for classification. As a classifier predicts either class labels or scores/probabilities, its performance can be evaluated based on these two notions. We show some performance measures for classification, including misclassification error rate (MCE), accuracy (ACC) and Brier score (BS). In addition, we will see confusion matrices and learn about costs.
